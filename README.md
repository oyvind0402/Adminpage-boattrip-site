The admin user uses an email and a password: "admin@admin.com - Admin1". 

To run the project you need to first type cd SemesterOppgave2/ClientApp from the root folder. Then you need to install a package from npm: "npm install --save @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap@5". This will install the package which is needed for the Modals that we use in conjunction with deleting different values in the database. 

Functionality choices: To be able to delete for instance a customer that is a part an order from the database, we need to enable cascading deletion in the database. This would then delete all the orders that the deleted customer is a part of. However we thought that this would be a bad thing for our database, because if you for instance delete a boat - then you would delete every route that boat is a part of. To add onto that you would also delete every order that route is a part of. So we thought through all the options, and decided on the admin not being able to delete a, lets say customer, until the admin had manually deleted all the orders that customer is a part of. The cascading deletion would get too out of hand, so we decided to just give the user a notification if they are trying to delete an entity in the database that is a part of another table as a foreign key.
